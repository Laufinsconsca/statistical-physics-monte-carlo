Pair correlation function simulation for liquid noble gases. 

The pair correlation function shows the ratio of the concentration at a given distance to the average concentration. 
Near zero, the function is zero, since the particles cannot come close to each other. 
When the distance between particles tends to infinity, the concentration tends to the average, so the ratio tends to 1. 
The Lennard-Jones potential is used to describe the interaction between particles.
